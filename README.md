# Frontend-Mentor-Stats-Preview
I did this challenge using HTML and CSS.

## I found this challenge on [frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62).

### Creation process.

I started with the design for the desktop view by creating a **_grid._**
This grid was split into two parts:
* A part for text
* Another for the image

After finishing the desktop I moved on to the mobile view where is used **_Flex_** instead of **_Grid_**

###Summary

If you have any comments on my code or how to improve it please do share your thoughts with me.
